## Git Crash Course ##

Most engineers favor **Git** as their preferred distributed version control system for their projects. Git allows you to store multiple versions of project files and directories, enabling you to revert to an earlier one in case of an issue. Since they are distributed, it streamlines collaboration for dev teams. What makes Git so crucial for many projects?

After completing this hands-on tutorial, you will have a clear understanding of the **Git** and **GitHub**.
