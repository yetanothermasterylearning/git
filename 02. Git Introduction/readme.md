- Git keeps track of the changes they make to code.
- Git is like a time machine for programming.
- Gitâ€™s Distributed nature makes it easy for programmers to work together on the same code. They can share their changes with others and even combine them into one code.
- It become the most widely used version control system due to its distributed nature, speed, and powerful features.

### What is GitHub? ###
- Github is a internet based code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
